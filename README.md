Neolayout Module
================

Neolayout is a module for SilverStripe that provides enhanced widget-like behaviour using re-usable components. Layouts can be added to pages or other objects so that CMS editors can place and configure components on their site.

Documentation is under the docs folder:

 *  cms_editing.md documents the behaviour that can be added to the CMS, and
    is intended for CMS users whose sites have had these features added.
 *  developer.md documents the module from a developers perspective, and
    and includes how to include and configure the module, and the ways in
    which the mechanisms provided can be added to the site.

Code repository is at http://github.com/mrmorphic/silverstripe-neolayout
