Neolayout in the CMS
====================

The neolayout module provides ways to include configurable layouts in your site. This can show up in different ways, depending on how the site has been set up by it's developers:

 *  Pages can have one or more layouts added to them. Each such layout
    is used to define components that are shown in a defined area of a
    page. Where there are multiple pages that have the same layout areas,
    different components can be used on each.
 *  The site may have enabled an NLEditableLayoutPage page type. This type of
    page typically has nothing defined in it's template; the entire
    content area of the page is a configurable layout.
